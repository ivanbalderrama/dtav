<h1> DTAV</h1>
<em>Pronounced (Data V)</em>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>

This app is used to decode VIN numbers on vehicles. It's sometimes difficult to know exactly what specs the vehicle comes with, but the user should be able to quickly find out by typing in their vin number.

<h3>What I used:</h3>

During my contract/internship at One Country I managed to learn more using React. So I wanted to implement some of what I learned into creating something that can not only be useful for me, but to other DIY users. I used axios to fetch data from a REST API on Auto.dev and returned the data to the user once the VIN is decoded. Usestate hook is also used to quickly update the history of VIN numbers that were decoded as well as the VIN number being typed.

<h3>Future:</h3>
My plans for this is to have a user friendly web application that may provide additional tech specifications about their vehicle for DIY projects. Whether it's oil, gas, antifreeze, or other liquids the user should be able to obtain that information using it.
