<h1> DTAV</h1>
<em>Pronounced (Data V)</em>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>

This app is used to decode VIN numbers on vehicles. It's sometimes difficult to know exactly what specs the vehicle comes with, but the user should be able to quickly find out by typing in their vin number.

<h3>What I used:</h3>

I used React to create this web application and when the end user submits a VIN number the VIN then gets input as a paramater to gather data from CarMD and display it to the user.

<h3>Future:</h3>
My plans for this is to have a user friendly web application that may provide additional tech specifications about their vehicle for DIY projects. Whether it's oil, gas, antifreeze, or other liquids the user should be able to obtain that information using it.
